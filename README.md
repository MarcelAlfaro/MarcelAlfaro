 Physicist with a Masterâ€™s in Applied Physics and strong expertise in data analysis, statistical
 modeling, and scientific computing. Experienced in working with large-scale datasets in
 high-performance environments. Passionate about solving real-world problems through
 data-driven insights and effective communication.

### ðŸŒ± I'm dedicated to continuously :
- Growing and expanding my skills in data science, always seeking new challenges and knowledge to apply to real-world problems.

###  ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on:
- Data analysis projects that involve end-to-end processes: from data extraction (SQL), cleaning, and transformation (Pandas) to exploratory data analysis (EDA) and reporting.
- Projects focused on building and evaluating basic machine learning models (e.g., regression, classification) using scikit-learn for predictive insights.
- Initiatives that require dashboard creation and data visualization to communicate findings effectively.

### ðŸ’¬ Ask me about:
- Data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis using Python with Pandas and NumPy.
- Writing efficient SQL queries for data retrieval and aggregation.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to discover patterns and insights.
