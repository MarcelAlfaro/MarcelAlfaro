ðŸ”­ I'm dedicated to continuously growing and expanding my skills in data science, always seeking new challenges and knowledge to apply to real-world problems.
ðŸ‘¥ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on:
* Data analysis projects that involve end-to-end processes: from data extraction (SQL), cleaning, and transformation (Pandas) to exploratory data analysis (EDA) and reporting.
*Projects focused on building and evaluating basic machine learning models (e.g., regression, classification) using scikit-learn for predictive insights.
*Initiatives that require dashboard creation and data visualization to communicate findings effectively.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about:
Data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis using Python with Pandas and NumPy.
Writing efficient SQL queries for data retrieval and aggregation.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to discover patterns and insights.
